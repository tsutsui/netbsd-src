.Sh NAME
.Nm creds_msdos
.Nd automatically add login credentials from MS-DOS partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar start
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
rc.d script allows automatic addition of login credentials during boot
using a special file found on the MS-DOS partition of a bootable image.
This script is not distributed with the normal system and is only
included with pre-installed bootable images.
The goal is to allow remote access of the system without having to
edit the primary root file system (which may not be accessible from
the host the image is being written from), but place this information
in the MS-DOS partition that most platforms can easily access.
.Pp
Typically, an installable image (such as
.Pa arm64.img )
is written to an SD card or similar media, and has both a native FFS
partition as well as an MS-DOS partition for booting.
If this script is enabled and has been pointed at the boot partition
it will inspect the file
.Pa creds.txt
for any credentials to be added to the system.
.Pp
The following list gives the supported options in the credentials files.
In all cases
.Ar user
is the username to be created, and the user will be added to the
.Ql wheel
group.
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.\"
.It Ic sshkeyfile Ar user Ar keyfile
Look for the
.Ar keyfile
in the MS-DOS boot partition and merge ssh keys from this file into user's
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
file.
.\"
.It Ic sshkey Ar user Ar keystring
Add the
.Ar keystring
to the user's
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
file.
.\"
.It Ic useraddpwhash Ar user Ar pwhash
Use
.Ar pwhash
as the users's password hash.
.\"
.It Ic useradd Ar user Ar password
Use
.Ar password
as the users's unencrypted raw password that will be hashed.
.Pp
This method is
.Em not recommended
as it leaves unencrypted passwords around until such time that the script runs.
If this method is used then the
.Pa creds.txt
file will be shredded and deleted using
.Ql rm -P
after the credentials are updated.
